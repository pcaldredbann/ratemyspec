## So what's this Rate My Spec all about then?

If you're a software development contractor, then it's very likely you have been shaking your head at many specs put forward by tech recruiters lately. Things like _with a view to extend_ and _you will join a dynamic and exciting team_ just really don't sit well when your relationship with said business is a business-to-business one. I mean, when you're looking for a plumber, you don't try to convince them by telling them they'll be working in a _exciting house_ or that you may have more work for them in future; That's because the relationship is business-to-business.

### Right, so you've had a whinge - but what is the point of this app?

Oh, yeah, sorry I have a tendency to do that... ok! This is a relatively straight forward app which you can use to copy-and-paste these specs and put it forward for ~scrutiny~ discussion within your friendly tech community. It could also be used by the more savvy tech recruiter to see if they should, or more likely should not, put a spec they have conjured up out to the market.
